Linear Dicriminate Analysis Project using data scrapped from the Mariners 2015 season.

This paper will use Mariners game data to explore and derive a classification model for predicting Mariners wins.
In the background section, we will discuss the context of our data. In the assumptions section, 
we will verify the assumptions that should be met when conducting the analysis. 
Using Linear Discriminant Analysis, this paper will create a predictive model that can be used to predict future observations of Mariners baseball game wins and losses. 
In the conclusions section, we will report our conclusions and discuss weaknesses of this analysis.
